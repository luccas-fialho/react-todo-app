## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS media queries
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was my first React project. I've worked with Angular before so I brought some concepts from there, with this and some youtube tutorials I was able to do what was meant to. 

One thing that was hard for me in this project was the conditional styles I had to apply to each component (or all of them) like the background images depending on the screen size, the dark mode and the checkboxes when a task is done.

I learned some React concepts like UseState hook and component syntax.
